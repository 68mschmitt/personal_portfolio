                <p>
                    My name is Michael Schmitt. I started coding when I was 16 after taking interest in the computer science course my school offered. Games were my motivation for learning to code, but I have since moved passed my desire to become a game developer; I'll just stick to playing them. Over the years I have moved from object oriented backend languages to complete frameworks, and now I find myself interested in full stack web development. My professional background has primarily been as a Full Stack .NET Developer, but I plan to jump back into front end web development to further hone my skills within the full stack.

                    I currently work full time at the Georgia General Assembly as a Full Stack .NET Developer. I primarily work with ASP MVC, MS SQL, and relevant technologies in between. I spend my idle time learning front end frameworks, such as React.js, and backend architecture methodologies.

                    I started at a database administration company as a database developer using MS data tools, such as SSIS. After 3 months I moved into a developer role to start new development for new and existing clients under hillside. My work was primarily split between two large and ongoing projects. One was a SAAS web application and the other was an internal tool to improve our business process.

                    I was hired over the course of two summers to help and learn from the software team based at AlienWare in Miami, FL. Here I was introduced and further honed my skills with .NET and C#. My stack consited of Windows forms and console applications.
